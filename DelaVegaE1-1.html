	<h2>About Myself</h2>
	<p>I am Christine Ysabelle A. Dela Vega. I am an 18 year old student taking up the course of BSIT in Silliman University. <br>
	I was formerly from Imus, Cavite, now living with my grandmother in Sibulan. I studied in Silliman during Nursery and returned in Senior Highschool. <br>
	I love doing arts and craft, drawing, and creating websites for easier navigation of the games I like. <br>
	I would say that encompass qualities of being a problem solver and posses creative thinking.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>My Student Info</h2>
	<p>Course: BSIT</p>
	<p>Year Level: 1</p>
	<p>Subjects Enrolled: CCS1, CCS2, GE4, GE10, PEP1, PE1, CHS1, PSLF, NSTP1</p>
	<br>
	<h2>My Goal</h2>
	<p>My goal for this academic year as a CCS student is that I learn more outside of my familiar coding languages and branch out into other fields as well as <br>
	to be more confident in my abilities as I tend to rely on having resources on my side in order to code.</p>
