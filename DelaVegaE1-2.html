	<p style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:19px;">I am Christine Ysabelle A. Dela Vega. I am an 18 year old student taking up the course of BSIT in Silliman University. <br>
	I was formerly from Imus, Cavite, now living with my grandmother in Sibulan. I studied in Silliman during Nursery and returned in Senior Highschool. <br>
	I love doing arts and craft, drawing, and creating websites for easier navigation of the games I like. <br>
	I would say that encompass qualities of being a problem solver and posses creative thinking.</p>

	<h2 style="color:#450920; background-color:#ffa5ab; font-family:Trebuchet MS;">My Goal</h2>
	<p style="font-size:19px; font-family:Verdana;">My goal for this academic year as a CCS student is that I learn more outside of my familiar coding languages and branch out into other fields as well as <br>
	to be more confident in my abilities as I tend to rely on having resources on my side in order to code.</p>
